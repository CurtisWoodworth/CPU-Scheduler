### Notes About this Project

This is my first attempt to build an assignment from scratch using github and tools like git, Travis CI, and pre-commit hooks. There may be additional tools that I use but this is an experiment for myself to set up a nice repository in hopes that when I need to work with a group that I can set up an environment we all can work in.
